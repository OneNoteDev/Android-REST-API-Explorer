Looking to build cool apps that help people work with their OneNote notebooks? Explore, learn, and understand the OneNote REST APIs by using the OneNote REST API Explorer for Android. This sample lets you view and run the REST APIs that read, add, update, and delete OneNote entities such as notebooks, section groups, sections, and pages. The app lets you authenticate in two ways. You can authenticate using a Microsoft Account (MSA) to connect to OneNote on your personal OneDrive. Or you can authenticate using a work or school account to connect to OneNote on your organization's OneDrive for Business on Office 365.

You can explore the following operations for OneNote:

**Notebook**

* Get a list of your notebooks
* Get notebooks and expand notebook sections
* Get a notebook by id
* Get metadata for a notebook
* Get notebooks by name
* Get a sorted list of notebooks with metadata

##Understand the code
The REST API Explorer project uses these classes to manage interactions with OneNote for Enterprise and consumer OneNote:
###Sample project organization
The REST API explorer project is comprised of four modules. The modular design allows you to add authentication and OneNote REST API support to your app by importing modules from REST API Explorer into your app. After you've imported the modules, use the code in the REST API Explorer [app](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/tree/master/app) module as an example of how to call methods in the other sample modules.
###REST API Explorer modules
* [```O365-Auth```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/tree/master/O365-auth). This module contains the library calls to authenticate a user with Office 365.
* [```onenoteapi```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/tree/master/onenoteapi). This module encapsulates the Retrofit REST operations used for the OneNote (enterprise and consumer) endpoints.
* [```onenotevos```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/tree/master/onenotevos). This module provides the value objects that wrap deserialized JSON REST response payloads. Use the value objects in your app logic to get the metadata and content of OneDrive notebooks, sections, and pages returned by the API.
* [```app```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/tree/master/app). The REST API explorer UI and business logic module. REST API Explorer consumes the **api** and **vo** modules from the logic in the app module. REST operations are started in the snippet classes in this module.

###Snippet classes
A snippet runs a single REST operation and returns the results. Snippets are found in the [app](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/tree/master/app) module. Snippets set the state required to make the calls on the OneNote service classes described below. Where necessary, a snippet class gets the notebooks, sections, or pages to load the spinner control shown on the snippet detail fragment for a given REST operation.
* [```NotebookSnippet```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/microsoft/o365_android_onenote_rest/snippet/NotebookSnippet.java)
* [```SectionGroupSnippet```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/microsoft/o365_android_onenote_rest/snippet/SectionGroupSnippet.java)
* [```SectionSnippet```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/microsoft/o365_android_onenote_rest/snippet/SectionSnippet.java)
* [```PagesSnippet```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/microsoft/o365_android_onenote_rest/snippet/PagesSnippet.java)
* [```AbstractSnippet```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/microsoft/o365_android_onenote_rest/snippet/AbstractSnippet.java)



###OneNote API service classes
These classes are found in the [onenoteapi](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/tree/master/onenoteapi) module and make the Retrofit library calls that generate the REST queries and handle operation results. These service classes are consumed by the snippets.
* [```NotebooksService```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/onenoteapi/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onenoteapi/service/NotebooksService.java)
* [```SectionGroupsService```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/onenoteapi/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onenoteapi/service/SectionGroupsService.java)
* [```SectionsService```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/onenoteapi/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onenoteapi/service/SectionsService.java)
* [```PagesService```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/onenoteapi/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onenoteapi/service/PagesService.java)

###Value object classes
These classes are found in the [onenotevos](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/tree/master/onenotevos) module. The value object classes describe JSON payloads as objects.

* [```BaseVO```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/onenotevos/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onenotevos/BaseVO.java). The superclass for other value objects. 
* [```Envelope```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/onenotevos/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onenotevos/Envelope.java). A collection of individual notebook, section, section group, or page objects returned in  GET request.
* [```Links```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/onenotevos/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onenotevos/Links.java). The collection of URLs returned in the body of a notebook, section, or page.
* [```Notebook```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/onenotevos/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onenotevos/Notebook.java). A OneNote notebook.
* [```Page```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/onenotevos/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onenotevos/Page.java). A OneNote page.
* [```Section```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/onenotevos/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onenotevos/Section.java). A OneNote section.
* [```SectionGroup```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/onenotevos/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onenotevos/SectionGroup.java). A OneNote section group.

###Authentication classes for Office 365 business accounts
The authentication classes are found in the [O365-Auth](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/tree/master/O365-auth) module. These classes use the [Microsoft Azure Active Directory Library (ADAL) for Android](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android) to connect to a business version of Office 365 such as Office 365 Enterprise. 

* [```AuthenticationManager```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/O365-auth/src/main/java/com/microsoft/AuthenticationManager.java). Encapsulates user connect and disconnect logic in addition to Azure app authorization.
* [```AzureADModule```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/O365-auth/src/main/java/com/microsoft/AzureADModule.java). Authentication helper class. 
* [```AzureAppCompatActivity```](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/Android-REST-API-Explorer/blob/master/O365-auth/src/main/java/com/microsoft/AzureAppCompatActivity.java). Dependency injection helper.

### Authentication for Office 365 personal accounts
Authentication for logging in with a Microsoft Account to a personal version of Office 365 such as Office 365 Home is handled by the [MSA Auth for Android](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/msa-auth-for-android) library. The app uses the [LiveAuthClient](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/msa-auth-for-android/blob/dev/src/main/java/com/microsoft/services/msa/LiveAuthClient.java) class to connect and disconnect.
